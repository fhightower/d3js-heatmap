# D3 Sortable Heatmap

The name just about says it all for this project.  This repo contains code for a heatmap that uses d3js and can be sorted by column and row values.  The code assumes that the values in the heatmap are numeric.

This is inspired by the heatmap [here](https://jsfiddle.net/nrabinowitz/Lk5Pw/ "d3js Heatmap Example").  Here is a screenshot of the heatmap:

**Disclaimer:** I am just starting to learn javascript and this is my first project using javascript, so any feedback is greatly appreciated.  I will be going back through this project and doing some cleanup in the near future.  Thanks!
